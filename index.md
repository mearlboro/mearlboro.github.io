I'm a computer scientist / creative from Romania and based in the UK. I have a computer engineering master's from Imperial College London, and I currently live in London about to start a PhD in complex systems. On the side I work on [SnowWall](https://snowwall.tech){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a privacy-oriented networking tool for Windows, and harangue whoever would listen about security and privacy.

My technical interests are in information theory, cryptography, functional programming, decentralised systems and ethical artificial intelligence.
Sometimes I also play with electronics (I'm a ham radio enthusiast) and I always wear my tin foil hat. My tools of the trade are a [Purism](https://puri.sm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} laptop running PureOS with i3wm, a Sony A7S and a Nokia _dumb_phone.

When I'm not staring into a computer screen, I take [photographs](https://instagram.com/rant.art){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, I read and I write. I also enjoy discussing literature and previously I ran a storytelling workshop in Bath.
Things I love to read are novels and stories, philosophy of mind, and neuroscience. Things I love to [listen to](https://youtube.com/user/mearlboro){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and look at are usually psychedelic, fractalicious and surreal. I prefer Koch to the Churchlands, Dali to Picasso, Dostoievski to Dickens.
