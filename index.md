I'm a computer scientist / creative from Romania based in South-East London. I have a computer engineering master's from Imperial College, and am currently pursuing a PhD in complex systems at Imperial's [Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. On the side I work on [SnowWall](https://snowwall.tech){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a privacy-oriented networking tool for Windows, and harangue whoever would listen about security and privacy.

My technical interests are in information theory, cryptography, functional programming, decentralised systems, and ethical artificial intelligence.
Sometimes I also play with electronics (I'm a ham radio enthusiast) and I always wear my tin foil hat. My tools of the trade are a [Purism](https://puri.sm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} laptop running PureOS with i3wm, a Sony A7S and a Nokia dumbphone.

When I'm not staring into a computer screen, I take photographs, I read and I write. I also enjoy discussing literature and previously I ran a storytelling workshop in Bath.
Things I love to read are novels and stories, philosophy of mind, and neuroscience. Things I love to [listen to](https://youtube.com/user/mearlboro){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and look at are usually psychedelic, fractalicious and surreal. I prefer Koch to the Churchlands, Dali to Picasso, Dostoievski to Dickens.

You can read more about my [experience](/experience) or my [projects](/projects) on this site, and if you would like to work together please [get in touch](/contact).
