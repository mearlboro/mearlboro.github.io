I'm a computer engineer / artist / creative from Romania and based in the UK. I have a computer engineering master's at Imperial College London, and I currently live in Bath where I work for [Netcraft](https://netcraft.com). On the side I work on [SnowWall](https://snowwall.tech), a privacy-oriented networking tool for Windows, and I design for [Rat's Tales](https://ratstales.co.uk) and [ShepherdTone](https://shepherdtone.co.uk).

I care about digital privacy, about simplicity and security in software, information theory and codes, cryptography, automation and distributed/decentralised technology, and ethical artificial intelligence. I love networks, visualisations, and natural language - writing it and processing it.

When I'm not working, I take [photographs](https://instagram.com/rant.art), I read and I write. Things I love to read are novels and stories, philosophy of mind, and neuroscience. Things I love to [listen to](https://youtube.com/user/mearlboro) and look at are usually psychedelic, fractalicious and surreal. I prefer Koch to the Churchlands, Dali to Picasso, Dostoievski to Dickens.

You can read more about my [experience](/experience) or my [projects](/projects) on this site, and if you would like to work together please [get in touch](/contact).
