I'm a scientist / creative from Romania based in South-East London. I have a computer engineering master's from Imperial College, and am currently pursuing a PhD in complex systems at Imperial's [Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where I research the emergence of self-organised collective behaviour, from the microscopic to the social scale.

My technical interests are in information theory, network science, cryptography, networking, functional programming and automation.
Previously I worked on [SnowWall](https://snowwall.tech){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a privacy-oriented networking tool for Windows, and harangue whoever would listen about security and privacy.
I also play with electronics (I'm a ham radio enthusiast) and I always wear my tin foil hat. My tools of the trade are a [Purism](https://puri.sm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} laptop, a Sony A7S, a [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and a [Banana Phone](/banana-hack).

When I'm not staring into a computer screen, I take photographs, I draw, I read and I write. I also enjoy discussing literature and previously I ran [a storytelling workshop](/story) in Bath.
Things I enjoy reading are novels and stories, philosophy of mind and anthropology. Things I love to [listen to](https://yewtu.be/user/mearlboro){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and look at are usually psychedelic, fractalicious and surreal. I prefer Koch to the Churchlands, Dali to Picasso, Dostoievski to Dickens.

You can read more about my [experience](/experience) or my [projects](/projects) on this site, read my [publications](/publications) or see recordings or slides of my [talks](/talks).
If you'd like me to work together on science, art, or cybersecurity, please [get in touch](/contact).
