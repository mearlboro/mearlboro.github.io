I'm a scientist, engineer and artist from Romania, currently based in London. I have a computer engineering master's from Imperial College and a PhD in complex systems at Imperial's [Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, during which I researched the emergence of self-organised collective behaviour, from the microscopic to the social scale, using information theory and signal processing.

My other technical interests are in network science, cryptography, functional programming, automation, and ethical artificial intelligence.
I am the creator of [SnowWall](https://snowwall.tech){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a privacy-oriented networking tool for Windows, and I harangue whoever would listen about security, privacy and digital sovereignty.
I also play with electronics (I'm a ham radio enthusiast) and I always wear my tin foil hat. My tools of the trade are a [Framework](https://frame.work){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} laptop running NixOS, a Sony Î±7s and a Fujifilm XT-4, a [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and a [Banana Phone](/banana-hack).

When I'm not staring into a computer screen, I take photographs, I draw, I read and I write. I also enjoy discussing literature and previously I ran [a storytelling workshop](/talks/story) in Bath.
Things I enjoy reading are novels and stories, philosophy of mind and anthropology. Things I love to [listen to](https://yewtu.be/user/mearlboro){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and look at are usually psychedelic, fractalicious and surreal. I prefer Koch to the Churchlands, Dali to Picasso, Dostoievski to Dickens.

You can read more about my [experience](/experience) or my [projects](/projects) on this site, read my [publications](/publications) or see recordings or slides of my [talks](/talks).
If you'd like me to work together on science, art, or cybersecurity, please [get in touch](/contact).
