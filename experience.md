# Education
<br/>

### Imperial College, London
#### Master's of Engineering
##### 2013 - 2017
A computer engineering degree which allowed me to gain profound experience into industry standard software engineering practices. Courses taken include the study of programming languages, operating systems, compilers, networks, security, information theory, software and web development, mathematics, logic, verification systems, Bayesian statistics, cryptography, and machine learning. Here I have worked on multiple projects which have given me experience to work on large codebases, coordinate with my team, and use agile methodologies:

- Completed [PintOS](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html) in a series of group courseworks, a version of the Standford operating systems exercise in C. Contributed with system calls, memory management, thread synchronisation and interruptions
- Implemented an Enigma machine simulation in C++ [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/enigma)
- Built an assembler and emulator for ARM architecture in a team project. Fully implemented in C, the system was meant for interacting with a Raspberry Pi. Generated the assembly necessary to encode a sequence of characters into a sequence of blinks on a set of LEDs using the [Dotsies](http://dotsies.org/) alphabet [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/ARM11)
- In a team project, implemented a static analysis tool written in Scala which parses a piece of code and transforms it into a logic statement, verifying against a set of pre and post-conditions whether the code is correct [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/srtool)
- Built an information extraction tool using statistical natural language processing [[Read more]](/projects#seek) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/seek-legacy)
- Implemented a compiler in Haskell in a team project for a simplified C-like language known as "WACC" [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/whack)
- Graduated with a first class degree and a distinguished master's project supervised by [Prof. William Knottenbelt](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/) [[Read more]](/projects#snowwall) [[thesis]](/assets/files/snowwall.pdf)

# experience

### Netcraft
#### Internet services developer 
##### 2017 - present
The work I do at [Netcraft](https://netcraft.com) is extensive and diverse. I currently work on improving and automating existing systems for countermeasures against phishing sites and malware. This is mostly in Perl, PHP, and Javascript.

During my time here I have also worked on content filtering of phishing sites, fraud detection on the web or on social platforms and security scanning. Moreover, through many evening and night shifts, I had learned to be responsible for emergencies and operations, and due to the flat and agile structure of the company, I was able to experience a broader side of how a security business works, gain management skills, work alone as well as in a team, and have direct contact with customers.

### The Maudsley Insitute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience
#### Junior Clinical Software Analyst
##### 2016
The [King's College Clinical Trials Unit](http://ctu.co.uk) supports researchers conducting non-commercial trials and is known for its independent Randomisation system, for its high efficiency and automation, as well as ground-breaking research. After working part-time with them for eighteen months, the KCTU hosted my six-month industrial placement, during which I have been responsible for full-stack development of a complex network of systems for running clinical trials. I used the .NET MVC5 with Entity Framework and a SQL Server Backend. Furthermore I have received an accreditation for .NET Development, and I have learned to develop for iOS. Some of the most intriguing tasks I tackled with were reverse engineering and working on low-level operating system management in Windows, in order to unify and simplify our stack.

I have completed my good clinical practice training, was part of some trial management meetings and worked on validation of data and studied statistical trial design. My work in clinical trials, especially focusing on mental health, have stimulated my interest in neuroscience and psychiatric research. During this time I have become acquainted with the [Maudsley Psychedelic Society](https://www.facebook.com/maudsleypsychedelicsociety/) and have attended most of their talks.

### Imperial College London
#### Undergraduate Researcher
##### 2015

With [Dr. Philippa Gardner](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pg/)'s research group we have researched methods of reasoning about concurrent data structures with an innovative new program logic, TaDA (a logic for Time and Data Abstraction), part of a family of modular and abstract concurrent separation logics. 

Using the expressive power of this logic, we have attempted to prove that Concurrent Red-Black Trees are a sound data structure in the context of multiprocess reads and writes. For the purpose of this project we have created a technical specification of Red-Black Trees which guarantees correct behaviour as well as implemented a prototype of such a concurrent Red-Black Tree in Haskell.

### Pureeros
#### Chief Technical Officer
##### 2015 - 2017
[Pureeros](https://pureeros.com) is a start-up dedicated to the empowering of women and the expression of their sexuality. As Pureeros was starting out, I acted as the chief technical officer, coordinating the technical side and sometmes joining the co-founders in meetings with investors and partners. I have lead the development of the e-commerce platform and the blog using Magento and Wordpress.

### Maudsley Insitute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience
#### Support Programmer
##### 2014 - 2016
During the second and third year of university I have worked part-time for the KCTU as a support programmer in a small team with only two developers. I have started by building and designing the KCTU [website](http://ctu.co.uk), then progressed to test, debug, and help develop applications for the back end of clinical trials systems with the .NET MVC5 framework.

### Google Munchen
#### Software Engineering Intern
##### 2014
During the summer I spent at Google Munchen we have worked in pairs to implement a set of dynamic web pages to change and update settings in the cloud, using the Guice dependency injection framework in Java for the backend and Soy templates and Clojure JS for the front-end. This has satisfied my passion for writing code functionally and taught me that the functional paradigm can be applied to any programming language. On the other hand, given the project I worked on ~~was debatably evil~~ never saw the light of day and was never spoken of again, this experience has taught me that ownership of work is one of my core principles and my place is in small companies or research positions where all team members can make their voice heard.
