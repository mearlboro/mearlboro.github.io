# work experience
<br/>

### Netcraft
#### Internet services developer
##### 2017 - 2020
My work at [Netcraft](https://netcraft.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} tackled many fields
of internet security. I have started with content filtering, then moved on to phishing site detection on the
web or social platforms, automated security examination of networks, and automated countermeasures against
internet fraud. Sometimes I would follow up where the automated systems were limited, doing detective work
to track down institutions or people all over the internet in order to let them know their website has been compromised.

I have also been one of the runners of the Netcraft Web Server Survey, which collects statistics about all websites on the internet.

### King's Clinical Trials Unit
#### Junior Clinical Software Analyst
##### 2016
Responsible with full-stack development of a complex network of systems for running clinical trials
and automatically randomising treatment assigned to patients to maximise statistical power of the
trial. Here I have received an accreditation for .NET Development and learned iOS development in Swift.
Some of the most intriguing technical tasks I tackled were reverse engineering and
low-level operating system management in Windows.

I have also completed Good Clinical Practice training, joined some trial management meetings and
worked on validation of data and trial design. My work in clinical trials, especially focusing on
mental health, have stimulated my interest in neuroscience and psychiatric research. During this time
I have become acquainted with the [Maudsley Psychedelic Society](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRh1HFc0_bZZh4MA4d-BqoA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and have attended most of their talks.

### Imperial College London
#### Undergraduate Researcher
##### 2015
With [Dr. Philippa Gardner](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pg/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}'s research
group we have investigated methods of reasoning about concurrent data structures with
an innovative new program logic for Time and Data Abstraction (TaDA) and attempted to prove that
Red-Black Trees are a sound data structure in the context of concurrent reads and writes. For the
purpose of this project we have created a technical specification of Red-Black Trees which guarantees
correct concurrent behaviour as well as implemented a prototype of such a concurrent data
structure in Haskell.

### Pureeros
#### Chief Technical Officer
##### 2015 - 2017
[Pureeros](https://pureeros.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is an e-commerce dedicated to the empowering of women and the expression of their sexuality. As Pureeros was starting out, I acted as the chief technical officer, coordinating the technical side and sometmes joining the co-founders in meetings with investors and partners. I have lead the development of the e-commerce platform and the blog using Magento and Wordpress.

### King's Clinical Trials Unit
#### Support Programmer
##### 2014 - 2016
During the second and third year of university I have worked part-time for the KCTU as a support programmer in a small team with only two developers. I have started by building and designing the KCTU [website](http://ctu.co.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, then progressed to test, debug, and help develop applications for the back end of clinical trials systems with the .NET MVC5 framework.
<br/>
<br/>


### Google
#### Software Engineering Intern
##### 2014
During the summer I spent at Google Munchen we have worked in pairs to implement a set of dynamic web pages to change and update settings in the cloud, using the Guice dependency injection framework in Java for the backend and Soy templates and Clojure JS for the front-end.

# Education
<br/>

### Imperial College, London, UK
#### Master's of Engineering
##### 2013 - 2017

I've graduated a four-year degree with a first class and honours. During my time at Imperial I had built many things, alone or in teams, of which the most notable:

- An assembler and emulator for ARM architecture in a team project. Fully implemented in C, the system was meant for interacting with a Raspberry Pi. Generated the assembly necessary to encode a sequence of characters into a sequence of blinks on a set of LEDs using the [Dotsies](http://dotsies.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} alphabet [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/ARM11){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- Completed [PintOS](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in a series of group courseworks, a version of the Standford operating systems exercise in C. Contributed with system calls, memory management, thread synchronisation and interruptions
- An Enigma machine simulation in C++ [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/enigma){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- A Javascript application with real-time collaborative digital painting features. Doodlr.js displays a gigantic board or wall of drawings where users can pick a specific canvas and join in collaborative drawing [github](https://github.com/mearlboro/doodlr.js){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- An information extraction tool using statistical natural language processing [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/seek-legacy){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- A static analysis tool written in Scala which parses a piece of code and transforms it into a logic statement, verifying against a set of pre and post-conditions whether the code is correct [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/srtool){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- A compiler in Haskell in a team project for a simplified C-like language known as "WACC" [[GitHub]](https://github.com/mearlboro/whack){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- For my masters, supervised by [Prof. William Knottenbelt](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/), I have written a thesis on privacy, internet architecture and geolocation and built a network monitoring tool with geographical data visualisation for Windows. The project was presented at the Imperial College Department of Computing distinguished projects day, at the London Met Cyber Unit and was a finalist of [HutZero](https://www.hutzero.co.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} 2018.
