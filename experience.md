### [Netcraft](https://netcraft.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
##### Oct 2017 - Feb 2020
#### Internet Services Developer
Started with content filtering, then moved on to phishing site detection on the
web or social platforms, automated security examination of networks, and automated countermeasures against
internet fraud. Sometimes I would follow up where the automated systems were limited, doing detective work
to track down institutions or people all over the internet in order to let them know their website has been compromised.
I have also run the Netcraft Web Server Survey, which collects comprehensive statistics about websites and hosts on the internet, and lead the redesign of the website.

### [King's Clinical Trials Unit](http://ctu.co.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}
##### Dec 2014 - Dec 2016
#### Junior Clinical Software Analyst
I started by designing and building the website, then progressed to test, debug, and develop applications for clinical
trials data collection and automatically randomising treatment assigned to patients to maximise
statistical power of the trial.
Here I completed [Good Clinical Practice](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/health-and-care-professionals/learning-and-support/good-clinical-practice.htm) training, received an accreditation for .NET Development and learned iOS development in Swift.
Some of the most intriguing technical tasks I tackled here were reverse engineering and
low-level operating system management in Windows.

My work in clinical trials, especially focusing on
mental health, have stimulated my interest in neuroscience and psychiatric research. During this time
I have become acquainted with the [Maudsley Psychedelic Society](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRh1HFc0_bZZh4MA4d-BqoA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and have attended most of their meetings.

Investigated methods of reasoning about concurrent data structures with
an innovative new program logic for Time and Data Abstraction (TaDA) and
created a technical specification of Red-Black Trees which guarantees
correct concurrent behaviour. Also implemented a prototype of such a concurrent data
structure in Haskell.
