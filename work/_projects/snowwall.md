#### privacy-oriented visual network monitoring
Motivated by privacy concerns and the lack of research on privacy on the Windows operating system, SnowWall is a networking tool designed to provide insights and control into the networking activity on a Windows-based system.

SnowWall is built on top of the Windows Firewall, using low-level networking APIs to gather the required information and interacting with the firewall to block unwanted outbound connections.

SnowWall interacts with the operating system, intercepts every inbound and outbound connection, provides information on the connectionâ€™s state, lifetime, owning process, and most importantly, remote end point, such as geolocation and ownership information. SnowWall is a powerful tool designed to be user-friendly, which allows anyone to block unwanted connections with high-level firewall rules, such as blocking by country or by owning organization name.
