### A Raspberry Pi LED headset

Light shows. We love light shows. So many people love light shows. From artists to hackers to ravers to marketers. From the stands at hacker conventions to the LED panels in Picadilly Circus. And what is ever better than a light show, is a _wearable_ light show.

Today we have played with the WS2801 LED strips and a Raspberry Pi and with an evening's worth of time and effort we have designed and built a LED headset.

This article is part of a series describing my collaboration with [Hillary Leone](https://hillaryleone.com) on [Synch.Live](https://www.synch.live).
To summarise, Synch.Live is a _game in which of groups of strangers try to solve a group challenge, without using words.  We will use a specially-designed headlamp, simple rules and a just-published algorithm to create the conditions for human emergence._
A discussion about emergence and the goals of the project is in a [previous article](/synch-live-part-1).


### The kit

We build a headset using the following parts:
- Raspberry Pi 3
- WS2801B controllable RGB LED strip, with at least 20 LED lights and connector
- power cable for the RPi
- a power bank of 10000mA (although we expect anything more than 5000mA will do, we shall test this properly in the future)
- black gaffer tape, to make the headbands that support the lights

We may also need the following tools at various times in the build:
- soldering iron, solder, and flux
- a needle
- extra lengths of wire
- a pot, to use as support when making the headbands
- multimeter, to check wiring

The lights on the headset must fulfill two functions:

First, we need a number of blinking lights that will be visible to the other players and capable of synchronising with other devices, which we call the **"crown lights"**.

For the purpose of tracking the players when filming them from above, we require another light or set of lights at the top of the head, which are independent of the crown lights.  We call these the **"pilot lights"**.

#### WS2801B LEDs

![](/assets/img/posts/synch/ws2801-lights.jpg)

The [WS2801B LED strip](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BTF-LIGHTING-WS2801-Addressable-Individual-Non-Waterproof/dp/B0713MQ7R6/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} has 32 RGB LEDs lights per meter, with a distance between them of about 3cm. They usually come on a strip with pretty good adhesive and can be attached to pretty much anything. The kit also includes a 4-pin connector cable. The variant we use is also waterproof!

There are many manufacturers making these, and it doesn't matter as long as they use the WS2801 integrated circuit, which is needed to drive each light. These can be connected in series making each LED individually addressible.
The strip needs only two data pins to connect to the Pi, which will also reduce the amount of wiring and soldering. Other variants, such as 2812, or 2811, may have different wiring and use different integrated circuits.

![](/assets/img/posts/synch/ws2801.jpg)

Moreover, the software package for it, made by [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, allows us to specify colours in 8-bit per channel RGB for each individual LED!

### Building the first prototype

The below guide focuses on a headless setup, namely, one that doesn't ever require directly using the Pi with a mouse, keyboard or screen. All of this set up can be done in many different ways, but my goal is to be able to reproduce this on many different devices, so I always chose the way that can be done non-interactively in the terminal as that can be put together into a setup script.


#### Quickstart a Raspberry Pi

1) **Install OS, enable SSH**

We download and install [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} onto a MicroSD card.

Before putting the card into the RPi, I always enable Secure SHell (`ssh`). This allows me to connect to the RPi from my own computer and perform the initial configuration remotely.
After the installation is complete, two drives will appear on the SD card. To enable `ssh`, simply create an empty file named `ssh` in the `/boot` drive.

Now remove the card from the PC, put it in the RPi, turn it on, and you're ready to go.


2) **Connect to network**

To be able to remotely log into the newly setup Pi, it first needs to be connected to a network, but first we need to remotely log into the Pi to join any password-protected network. Chicken-and-egg problem.

Thankfully the RPi 2 has an ethernet port so we simply plug the Pi into the LAN and a wired connection requires no password.
Now to `ssh` into it from another machine, this machine needs to be in the same network. We also need to know its IP address, username, and password. The default username and password are usually `pi` and `raspberry`.

IP address is usually dynamically allocated by the router so we have to check.
The IP address we are interested in is in the local network, so it will most likely begin with `192.168`.
Probably easiest way is to login to your router in the browser (usually by visiting `192.168.1.1` or similar, check with your router manufacturer), and find the RPi and its IP in the list of connected devices.

Perhaps overkill, but I used `nmap` for this, which allows me to list all devices in a network with their hostnames and what services they are running.

```console
$ nmap 192.168.1.1/24
```

Which reveals my RPi's IP address is `192.168.1.101`, and it has an open port for the SSH service, confirming that I can connect to it by running `ssh pi@192.168.1.101`.


3) **Set hostname**

The default hostname for every RPi after initial setup is `raspberrypi`. In the future, we wish to deploy new Pis and keep track of IP addresses and hostnames, which will be difficult with multiple devices with the same default hostname.

While still remotely logged in to the RPi, we change the hostname by editing `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname` files and replacing `raspberrypi` with the desired hostname. I named ours `player0`:

```console
$ sudo sed -i 's/raspberrypi/player0/g' /etc/hosts
$ sudo sed -i 's/raspberrypi/player0/g' /etc/hostname
```

After changing the files, run the following commands to make the changes persistent, and the hostname should update to `player0` and should remain the same after rebooting.

```console
$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
$ sudo hostnamectl --static --transient --pretty set-hostname player0
```

To check, type `hostname` in the terminal. Restart the Pi and check again.

In an ideal universe, the IP addresses should remain static and the hostnames are allocated incrementally as each new device is setup: `player1`, `player2` and so on. For this we will require to setup some sort of nameserver. But not today.

4) **Soldering the lights**

The average circomference of the adult human head allows about 15-16 of these LEDs into the crown light.
We also use 4-5 LEDs to act as pilot lights.
The LED strip can be cut with a scissors anywhere and soldered back again in order to allow the LEDs to be placed however and wherever we want.

![](/assets/img/posts/synch/cut.gif)

We cut the LED strip after 16 lights, obtaining a strip with the power connector at one side, and again after 4 more which leaves us with a loose strip. The four golden connectors at the end of the strip can be punched with a needle and wires drawn through it, which we solder together, allowing some 5cm of wire between the two strips.

5) **Wiring the lights to the RPi**

Sensors and lights generally use the RPi's GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) interface, which offers a direct connection to the Pi's system-on-chip. Besides data connections, some of the pins also can provide electricity, others can act as ground pins. The WS2801 LEDs will use the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) pins.
Data is synchronised using a clock over the SCLK pin and sent from the Pi to our LED strip using the MOSI pin.

The lights have four pins:
* 5V, to be connected to + on our power supply
* GND, ground, to be connected to GND (Pin 6) on the Pi
* DI (sometimes SI), a data pin, to be wired to SCKL (Pin 19) on the pi
* CI (sometimes CK), another data pin, to be wired to MOSI (Pin 23) on the Pi

![](/assets/img/posts/synch/wiring-diag.png)

6) **Power delivery**

Each individual LED consumes about 60mA at DC5V. Times 20, that's 1.2A. The GPIO of Raspberry Pi can usually deliver about 18mA by GPIO per pin, so we shouldn't try to drive the lights, or any relevant peripherals in general, through the RPi's power supply. A discussion about this can be found [here](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/9298/what-is-the-maximum-current-the-gpio-pins-can-output){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Since in general the RPi's internal power management cannot drive all the LEDs safely, we are feeding power to both the RPi and the LEDs in parallel from the same 2A rail of the power bank. Ground/earth must also be done in parralel. Now the maximum load is up to the USB output of the battery pack and not to the limits of the GPIO 5V rail.

As the RPi 2 features GPIO pins (unlike the RPi Zero W, which has holes to solder to), we can use the connector that comes with the lights and just plug them in.

Our wiring looks a little messy but it works:

![](/assets/img/posts/synch/wired.png)

To create a headband to attach the lights and the RPi to, we use a pot and gaffer tape.

![](/assets/img/posts/synch/headband.png)

Our prototype headset looks like this:

<div class="col-1-of-2"><img src="/assets/img/posts/synch/headset-build-2.JPG"></div>
</div>

<br/>

Incorrect wiring or power delivery could fry the lights, the RPi, or both, so we have used a voltmeter to check before turning it on.

#### Interacting with the LEDs

7) **Enable SPI**

To control the lights the SPI interface needs to be enabled in the OS kernel. Add the following line `dtparam=spi=on` at the end of the config file `/boot/config.txt`, then reboot.

```console
$ sudo sed -i "$ a dtparam=spi=on" /boot/config.txt
$ sudo reboot
```

To check if its enabled, the `lsmod` command lists the kernel modules the system can detect. Something called `spi` should be listed there, and we can use `grep` to find it:

```console
$ sudo lsmod | grep spi_
```

The output should list something like `spi_bcm` and a four digit number. To troubleshoot, a number of alternative ways of turning SPI on are listed [here](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/08/enabling-the-spi-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

8) **Install libraries**

We should always begin by pulling the latest software updates, then we install the Python package manager `pip` and the required `spidev` packages for the SPI interface. The SPI packages should be already there for the current Raspbian, but in case you encounter issues, the same instructions linked above should help.

The `adafruit` package provides an interface for controlling the LEDs.

We are using Python3 as it supports many features we may want to use in the future iterations of this project.

```console
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-spidev
$ sudo pip3 install adafruit-ws2801
```

9) **Write the code**

The first step is to import the `adafruit-ws2801` module as well as the `GPIO` module. This allows us to define a variable, `leds`, which is an array of RGB pixels representing each LED. Since we use 20 LEDs in our headset, we define the `LED_COUNT` to be 20.

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import Adafruit_WS2801
import Adafruit_GPIO.SPI as SPI

LED_COUNT = 20
SPI_PORT   = 0
SPI_DEVICE = 0
leds = Adafruit_WS2801.WS2801Pixels(PIXEL_COUNT,
  spi=SPI.SpiDev(SPI_PORT, SPI_DEVICE), gpio=GPIO)
```

Now we can use the function `set_pixel`, which takes two parameters, an index for the pixel number, and a colour, which we obtain by using the function `Adafruit.RGB_to_color`. The index 0 is the closest pixel to the connector. Every time we make a change in code to one of the pixels, you should use `pixels.show()`, otherwise no change will occur to the lights.

To turn of all LEDs, you can use `pixels.clear()`

To make the lights blink twice in blue, red, and green repeatedly, while waiting a little bit in between, we can use the following code. Remember to `import time` at the top so we can wait during the blinks and in between blinks using the function `time.sleep(seconds)`

```python
def blink(leds, col):
  leds.clear()
  for i in range(2):
    for k in range(leds.count()):
      leds.set_pixel(k,
        Adafruit_WS2801.RGB_to_color(col[0], col[1], col[2]))
    leds.show()
    time.sleep(0.1)
    leds.clear()
    leds.show()
    time.sleep(0.1)
  time.sleep(0.5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  leds.clear()
  leds.show()

  while True:
    blink(leds, color=(0, 0, 255)
    blink(leds, color=(255, 0, 0)
    blink(leds, color=(0, 255, 0)

```

Let's save all of this into a file, and call it `ledcontrol.py`, and put it in the home folder, `/home/pi`. Now we can run `python3 ledcontrol.py` and the LEDs will turn on!

You may play with this to your heart's content. You can install interactive python (`sudo apt-get install ipython`) and put in the imports and definition of the `leds` variable from above, then write code and tell the lights what to do interactively. It's pretty rewarding.

10) **Run at startup**

Finally, we want our script that makes the lights blink to run when the Pi is turned on without us having to run it ourselves. To do this, you can add a `.desktop` file to `/home/pi/.config/autostart`, which will tell Raspbian that our script should automatically start when turning on the system. The desktop file should have the following contents

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=ledcontrol
Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/ledcontrol.py
Type=application
```

### Future work

As this is only a prototype, we can observe some issues with it right away. The battery is too unwieldy, and the RPi is too big. We will redo the work with a RPi Zero W, which is much smaller, and we'll be running battery tests to see what is the smallest battery can use. In the next steps, we will also add a RTC (Real Time Clock) module to our system, and look into programming the synchronising behaviour.

Moreover, we will need to consider software for setting up and deploying a whole fleet of such headsets. From managing their hostnames to their software updates.

I'll shall now leave you with a last headlight delight:
