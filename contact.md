# contact me
 I have approximate knowledge of many things, so if you ever feel like talking about anything just drop me a line and I'd love to reply a highly literate and metaphoric rant, buy you a cup of coffee, make your website, take your picture, peek into your soul.

If you're interested in working with me, or just getting in touch, contact me at *madalina.sas@pm.me*. To learn more about my experience you can have a look at my [CV](/assets/files/mis_cv.pdf), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madalina-sas-924130a9) or [GitHub](https://github.com/mearlboro).

If you wish to talk about SnowWall, privacy, and paranoia *ms@snowwall.tech* is the right place. 

I prefer encrypted communication so here's [my public key](/assets/files/mis.asc).


# this site
This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is a live work in progress. Because I always learn and always change, so does this site. For now, it looks a little bit different every time you visit it. A more immersive and interactive experience is coming soon.

To keep in touch with further developments of this site and more exciting projects, feel free to subscribe [via RSS](/feed.xml).
